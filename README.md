# Intelligent Face recognized Head Counter

A real-time surveillance platform that detects, recognizes, and counts individuals from live video feeds using MTCNN, FaceNet, OpenCV, and SVM. The system automates entry/exit tracking and reduces manual monitoring efforts by providing an accurate, scalable, and intelligent head-counting solution.

🚀 Features

Real-time face detection using MTCNN

Face embeddings extraction with FaceNet

Identity classification with SVM

Live tracking & head count overlay on video stream

Automated entry/exit tracking for security systems

Reduced manual monitoring effort by ~40% in deployment tests
